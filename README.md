Flask Plus Project Alterations- Author: Ethan Godsey

This project is a CS253 assignment which works on implementing Flask with 
Python. Originally, the flask app had a non-functional post template where a
user could type a title and expand more in a paragraph text box below.

This project aims to allow the following functionality:
* Display posts the user submits
* Allow for users to add a category to their post
* Allow for user to filter by post category
* Allow user to delete posts
* Allow user to see all posts and only filters of posts

This project aims to combine elements of SQL, Flask, and frontend languages
like HTML/CSS and java
